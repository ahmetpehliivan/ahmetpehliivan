## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ahmet

I graduated in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. During my university education, I learned the basic knowledge of the software and made projects using Java and C programming languages.  I have been working to expand my knowledge in software field since I graduated from university. In this process, I worked on Java and spring boot. My goal is to be a good sotware developer who is able to understand any project on the both practical and theoretical sides and having experince and knowledge to solve the problems that may arise.
